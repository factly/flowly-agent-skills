# Flowly Agent Skills

**Production-grade engineering skills for AI coding agents, packaged for teams that run their software lifecycle in [Flowly](https://github.com/factly/flowly).**

Skills encode the workflows, quality gates, and best practices that senior engineers use when building software. These ones are packaged so AI agents follow them consistently across every phase of development.

Skills activate automatically based on what you're doing — designing an API triggers `api-and-interface-design`, building UI triggers `frontend-ui-engineering`, and so on.

## Status

This distribution is **under construction and not yet announced**. What is here today is the
inherited corpus — 24 skills, 4 agent personas, 7 reference checklists — plus the structural gates
that everything authored afterwards has to pass.

**No slash commands ship yet.** The lifecycle commands that are the point of this fork — each taking
a Flowly issue identifier, so that `/flowly:plan FLO-1234` writes that issue's planning docs through
Flowly's MCP surface rather than to a local file — are authored next. Until then the plugin declares
no command directory and installs 24 skills.

There is no semver contract. The manifests carry `0.1.0` because the plugin validator requires a
version, not because anything is promised about compatibility.

---

## Install

Claude Code is the shipped door.

```
/plugin marketplace add factly/flowly-agent-skills
/plugin install flowly@flowly-agent-skills
```

> **SSH errors?** The marketplace clones repos via SSH. If you don't have SSH keys set up on GitHub, either [add your SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account) or use the full HTTPS URL to force HTTPS cloning during the marketplace-add step:
> ```bash
> /plugin marketplace add https://github.com/factly/flowly-agent-skills.git
> /plugin install flowly@flowly-agent-skills
> ```
>
> If `/plugin install` still fails with a `Permission denied (publickey)` error on Windows or macOS, the recommended workaround is to configure Git once to rewrite GitHub SSH URLs to HTTPS for subprocess clones:
> ```bash
> git config --global url."https://github.com/".insteadOf git@github.com:
> ```

**Local / development:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/factly/flowly-agent-skills.git
claude --plugin-dir /path/to/flowly-agent-skills
```

Other doors — the `skills` CLI for a flat install, and Codex's native plugin format — are kept
*openable* but are not shipped, not tested, and deliberately not documented here. Two authoring rules
hold them open at no cost: skill frontmatter carries exactly `name` and `description`, and no command
body contains a substitution token. Both are enforced by checks in `scripts/`.

## Adoption

Already installed? How you roll the pack out depends on your codebase. The **[Adoption Guide](docs/adoption-guide.md)** covers two paths: the full lifecycle from day one for a greenfield project, or an incremental, verification-first rollout for an established codebase.

---

## All 24 Skills

The pack includes 24 skills total — 23 lifecycle skills plus the `using-agent-skills` meta-skill. Each skill is a structured workflow with steps, verification gates, and anti-rationalization tables. You can also reference any skill directly.

### Meta - Discover which skill applies

| Skill | What It Does | Use When |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| [using-agent-skills](skills/using-agent-skills/SKILL.md) | Maps incoming work to the right skill workflow and defines shared operating rules | Starting a session or deciding which skill applies |

### Define - Clarify what to build

| Skill | What It Does | Use When |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| [interview-me](skills/interview-me/SKILL.md) | One-question-at-a-time interview that extracts what the user actually wants instead of what they think they should want, until ~95% confidence | The ask is underspecified, or the user invokes "interview me" / "grill me" |
| [idea-refine](skills/idea-refine/SKILL.md) | Structured divergent/convergent thinking to turn vague ideas into concrete proposals | You have a rough concept that needs exploration |
| [spec-driven-development](skills/spec-driven-development/SKILL.md) | Write a PRD covering objectives, commands, structure, code style, testing, and boundaries before any code | Starting a new project, feature, or significant change |

### Plan - Break it down

| Skill | What It Does | Use When |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| [planning-and-task-breakdown](skills/planning-and-task-breakdown/SKILL.md) | Decompose specs into small, verifiable tasks with acceptance criteria and dependency ordering | You have a spec and need implementable units |

### Build - Write the code

| Skill | What It Does | Use When |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| [incremental-implementation](skills/incremental-implementation/SKILL.md) | Thin vertical slices - implement, test, verify, commit. Feature flags, safe defaults, rollback-friendly changes | Any change touching more than one file |
| [test-driven-development](skills/test-driven-development/SKILL.md) | Red-Green-Refactor, test pyramid (80/15/5), test sizes, DAMP over DRY, Beyonce Rule, browser testing | Implementing logic, fixing bugs, or changing behavior |
| [context-engineering](skills/context-engineering/SKILL.md) | Feed agents the right information at the right time - rules files, context packing, MCP integrations | Starting a session, switching tasks, or when output quality drops |
| [source-driven-development](skills/source-driven-development/SKILL.md) | Ground every framework decision in official documentation - verify, cite sources, flag what's unverified | You want authoritative, source-cited code for any framework or library |
| [doubt-driven-development](skills/doubt-driven-development/SKILL.md) | Adversarial fresh-context review of every non-trivial decision in-flight - CLAIM → EXTRACT → DOUBT → RECONCILE → STOP, with optional user-authorized cross-model escalation | Stakes are high (production, security, irreversible), working in unfamiliar code, or a confident output is cheaper to verify now than to debug later |
| [frontend-ui-engineering](skills/frontend-ui-engineering/SKILL.md) | Component architecture, design systems, state management, responsive design, WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility | Building or modifying user-facing interfaces |
| [api-and-interface-design](skills/api-and-interface-design/SKILL.md) | Contract-first design, Hyrum's Law, One-Version Rule, error semantics, boundary validation | Designing APIs, module boundaries, or public interfaces |

### Verify - Prove it works

| Skill | What It Does | Use When |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| [browser-testing-with-devtools](skills/browser-testing-with-devtools/SKILL.md) | Chrome DevTools MCP for live runtime data - DOM inspection, console logs, network traces, performance profiling | Building or debugging anything that runs in a browser |
| [debugging-and-error-recovery](skills/debugging-and-error-recovery/SKILL.md) | Five-step triage: reproduce, localize, reduce, fix, guard. Stop-the-line rule, safe fallbacks | Tests fail, builds break, or behavior is unexpected |

### Review - Quality gates before merge

| Skill | What It Does | Use When |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| [code-review-and-quality](skills/code-review-and-quality/SKILL.md) | Five-axis review, change sizing (~100 lines), severity labels (Nit/Optional/FYI), review speed norms, splitting strategies | Before merging any change |
| [code-simplification](skills/code-simplification/SKILL.md) | Chesterton's Fence, Rule of 500, reduce complexity while preserving exact behavior | Code works but is harder to read or maintain than it should be |
| [security-and-hardening](skills/security-and-hardening/SKILL.md) | OWASP Top 10 prevention, auth patterns, secrets management, dependency auditing, three-tier boundary system | Handling user input, auth, data storage, or external integrations |
| [performance-optimization](skills/performance-optimization/SKILL.md) | Measure-first approach - Core Web Vitals targets, profiling workflows, bundle analysis, anti-pattern detection | Performance requirements exist or you suspect regressions |

### Ship - Deploy with confidence

| Skill | What It Does | Use When |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| [git-workflow-and-versioning](skills/git-workflow-and-versioning/SKILL.md) | Trunk-based development, atomic commits, change sizing (~100 lines), the commit-as-save-point pattern | Making any code change (always) |
| [ci-cd-and-automation](skills/ci-cd-and-automation/SKILL.md) | Shift Left, Faster is Safer, feature flags, quality gate pipelines, failure feedback loops | Setting up or modifying build and deploy pipelines |
| [deprecation-and-migration](skills/deprecation-and-migration/SKILL.md) | Code-as-liability mindset, compulsory vs advisory deprecation, migration patterns, zombie code removal | Removing old systems, migrating users, or sunsetting features |
| [documentation-and-adrs](skills/documentation-and-adrs/SKILL.md) | Architecture Decision Records, API docs, inline documentation standards - document the *why* | Making architectural decisions, changing APIs, or shipping features |
| [observability-and-instrumentation](skills/observability-and-instrumentation/SKILL.md) | Structured logging, RED metrics, OpenTelemetry tracing, symptom-based alerting - instrument as you build | Adding telemetry, or shipping anything that runs in production |
| [shipping-and-launch](skills/shipping-and-launch/SKILL.md) | Pre-launch checklists, feature flag lifecycle, staged rollouts, rollback procedures, monitoring setup | Preparing to deploy to production |

## Agent Personas

Pre-configured specialist personas for targeted reviews:

| Agent | Role | Perspective |
|-------|------|-------------|
| [code-reviewer](agents/code-reviewer.md) | Senior Staff Engineer | Five-axis code review with "would a staff engineer approve this?" standard |
| [test-engineer](agents/test-engineer.md) | QA Specialist | Test strategy, coverage analysis, and the Prove-It pattern |
| [security-auditor](agents/security-auditor.md) | Security Engineer | Vulnerability detection, threat modeling, OWASP assessment |
| [web-performance-auditor](agents/web-performance-auditor.md) | Web Performance Engineer | Core Web Vitals audit with Quick/Deep modes and a metric-honesty rule |

See [docs/agents.md](docs/agents.md) for the decision matrix, orchestration rules, and how personas compose with skills.

## How Skills Work

Every skill follows a consistent anatomy:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  SKILL.md                                       │
│                                                 │
│  ┌─ Frontmatter ─────────────────────────────┐  │
│  │ name: lowercase-hyphen-name               │  │
│  │ description: Guides agents through [task].│  │
│  │              Use when…                    │  │
│  └───────────────────────────────────────────┘  │
│  Overview         → What this skill does        │
│  When to Use      → Triggering conditions       │
│  Process          → Step-by-step workflow       │
│  Rationalizations → Excuses + rebuttals         │
│  Red Flags        → Signs something's wrong     │
│  Verification     → Evidence requirements       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key design choices:**

- **Process, not prose.** Skills are workflows agents follow, not reference docs they read. Each has steps, checkpoints, and exit criteria.
- **Anti-rationalization.** Every skill includes a table of common excuses agents use to skip steps (e.g., "I'll add tests later") with documented counter-arguments.
- **Verification is non-negotiable.** Every skill ends with evidence requirements - tests passing, build output, runtime data. "Seems right" is never sufficient.
- **Progressive disclosure.** The `SKILL.md` is the entry point. Supporting references load only when needed, keeping token usage minimal.
- **Frontmatter is two fields.** `name` and `description`, nothing else — the intersection that loads on every door. Enforced by `scripts/validate-standard.sh`.

└── NOTICE.md                          # derivation, base SHA, and the ownership register
```

The plugin manifest declares `skills` and deliberately declares **no** command directory: declaring
`commands` *replaces* Claude Code's default scan rather than adding to it, so authoring at the
default path and staying silent is what keeps both working.

## Checks

Four gates run over this repository. Each one has a mutation that turns it red, which is the only
reason to believe it works:

| Check | Asserts | Turns red when |
|---|---|---|
| `node scripts/validate-skills.js` | Frontmatter, description trigger and length, required sections, `name` matches the directory | A required section is deleted |
| `./scripts/validate-standard.sh` | Frontmatter carries exactly `name` and `description` | Any third key is added |
| `node scripts/check-no-hosts.js` | No hostname outside a curated allowlist, and no absolute workspace path, anywhere in the tree | Any new hostname appears |
| `node scripts/check-register.js` | Every shipped file is registered exactly once, the base SHA is an ancestor of `HEAD`, and every `unchanged` file really is byte-identical to it | A file is added without a register row |

`check-no-hosts.js` is the one that matters most. This repository is public, making a repository
public later does not scrub its history, and GitHub's push protection matches credential patterns —
a hostname matches none of them.

## Why skills?

AI coding agents default to the shortest path - which often means skipping specs, tests, security reviews, and the practices that make software reliable. These skills give agents structured workflows that enforce the same discipline senior engineers bring to production code.

Each skill encodes hard-won engineering judgment: *when* to write a spec, *what* to test, *how* to review, and *when* to ship. These aren't generic prompts - they're the kind of opinionated, process-driven workflows that separate production-quality work from prototype-quality work.

Skills bake in best practices from Google's engineering culture — including concepts from [Software Engineering at Google](https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book) and Google's [engineering practices guide](https://google.github.io/eng-practices/). You'll find Hyrum's Law in API design, the Beyonce Rule and test pyramid in testing, change sizing and review speed norms in code review, Chesterton's Fence in simplification, trunk-based development in git workflow, Shift Left and feature flags in CI/CD, and a dedicated deprecation skill treating code as a liability. These aren't abstract principles — they're embedded directly into the step-by-step workflows agents follow.

---

## Contributing

Skills should be **specific** (actionable steps, not vague advice), **verifiable** (clear exit criteria with evidence requirements), **battle-tested** (based on real workflows), and **minimal** (only what's needed to guide the agent).

See [docs/skill-anatomy.md](docs/skill-anatomy.md) for the format specification and [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines.
